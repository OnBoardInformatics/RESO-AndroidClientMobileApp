RESO-AndroidClientMobileApp
===========================

RESO API Mobile Application Development using Android SDK

Since we are using Custom Methods on WebGet with datas coming from the stored procedures though following existing query option standard in the RESO Implementation we are not able to use any existing client library for oData processing.

The code is built using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 with Xamarin plugin provided by Xamarin studios.
